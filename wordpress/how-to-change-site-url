## How to change the site url

1. FTP to the site, and get a copy of the active theme's functions.php file. You're going to edit it in a simple text editor and upload it back to the site.

2. Add these two lines to the file, immediately after the initial "<?php" line.

```
update_option( 'siteurl', 'http://example.com' );
update_option( 'home', 'http://example.com' );

```
Use your own URL instead of example.com, obviously.

3. Upload the file back to your site, in the same location. FileZilla offers a handy "edit file" function to do all of the above rapidly; if you can use that, do so.

4. Load the login or admin page a couple of times. The site should come back up.


Important! Do not leave those lines in the functions.php file. Remove them after the site is up and running again.
